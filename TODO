TODO list for promptspace
-------------------------

-- make it work in both 16-bit and 24-bit true color modes.
-- implement a GUI for basic functions
+? debug Viewing Transformation, derive it from Transformation if
possible
-- implement matrix caches for Transformation objects
-- check expression templates for vector ops etc.
-- compress and cache normal vectors
-- compress and cache shading: L, V, I(N,L,V)
-- implement slice and line iterators
-- make the s/w fac code functional
-- implement RLE encodings (transparent voxel omission) for s/w fac
-- implement disjoint sets (early ray termination) for s/w fac
/- correct floating point errors in code, check rounding funs
-- implement slice animators (spherical[onion strip], cylindrical...)

Changes
-------

++ fixed: correct normal vector resampling code
++ fixed: angles of shading function doesn't seem to work
++ correct shading function, it seems to break continuity in image
++ fixed: point resampling doesn't seem to work well when the image is
   big in the ray caster.
++ correct normal vector resampling code
++ in Camera, Ray should be an aggregate
